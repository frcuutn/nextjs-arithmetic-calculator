## Features

- **Next.js API Routes**: Utilized for building backend APIs, reducing development time.
- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are included to validate the functionality of critical components, including API routes, service layers, and utility functions.
- **Pagination**: Implementing pagination for better user experience and optimized data loading.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing application data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling components.
- **JWT Authentication**: Used JWT-based authentication for securing API endpoints.
- **Deployment on Vercel**: Project deployment is facilitated using Vercel's free service account, ensuring seamless hosting and scaling capabilities.

## Improvements and Future Enhancements

- **State Management**: Consider integrating context or Redux for efficient state management across components.
- **OAuth Integration**: Explore integrating OAuth-based authentication for seamless user authentication via third-party providers.
- **Server Framework for AWS**: Evaluate using server frameworks like Express.js or Nest.js for backend APIs, facilitating deployment on AWS services.
- **Containerization**: Dockerize PostgreSQL to streamline local development setup and testing.
- **Dependency Injection**: Evaluate using Dependency Injection (DI) to reduced coupling, enhance testability and maintainability of service layers.
- **ORM Implementation**: Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) like TypeORM or Sequelize to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities and simplify database interactions.
